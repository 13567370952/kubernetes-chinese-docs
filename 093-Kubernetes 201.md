# **Kubernetes 201 - 标签, 副本控制, 服务和健康检查**

如果你浏览过[Kubernetes 101](http://kubernetes.io/v1.0/docs/user-guide/walkthrough/README.html), you learned about kubectl, pods, volumes, and multiple containers. For Kubernetes 201, we will pick up where 101 left off and cover some slightly more advanced topics in Kubernetes, related to application productionization, deployment and scaling.

In order for the kubectl usage examples to work, make sure you have an examples directory locally, either from a release or the source.
